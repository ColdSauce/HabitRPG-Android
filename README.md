# HabitRPG Android
## What is this?
This is a 3rd party Android app client of the game/app HabitRPG.

According to their website, "HabitRPG is a free habit building and productivity app that treats your real life like a game." To me, HabitRPG is the most positively impactful thing I have ever added to my life. It has increased my productivity and orginizational skills by double, if not triple. 

The current Android apps for HabitRPG are not so great. I always like to keep busy so I thought I'd make an app that does HabitRPG justice.
